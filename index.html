                            Steep falls in life are diﬃcult to overcome. Especially when its your maiden fall. 
                            Admission into MEC for almost all of us was a result of such a fall. 
                            With it's small campus, MEC wasnt the college of our dreams to any extent and hence we all were disappointed. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">The eclipse began to shift when the classes began. 
                            This was when we learned to cherish even those small moments.
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">
                            If the past one year was a series, it would look something like this: <br>
                            <br>
                            Season 1:&nbsp;&nbsp; My classmates are mental!<br>
                            Season 2:&nbsp;&nbsp; I am mental!! <br>
                            Season 3:&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallahi, We are all mental!!!<br> 
                            Season 4:&nbsp;&nbsp; Thomas! Thomas!! Thomas!  
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">
                            Yeah, that's CSA for you. We are all geeks with perfect track records from our school days, 
                            all from different backgrounds, all with different skillsets. No two people in CSA are the same.<br><br>
                            Yet, our unity doesn't seem to have boundaries. 
                            It is this unity of ours that sets us apart from the others. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">
                            Every day in CSA is a memory. This class is live and has 61 hearts pumping it to life. 
                            We ain't sad of our past shortcomings nomore coz we are certain, by every passing day, 
                            that we were brought together for a reason and every day, we celebrate this togetherness.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead" id="sign">We are CSA. <br>We make things happen.

                        <p class="lead">We, on the outside, seems to be a class that has somehow landed from outer space. 
                            We ﬁnd joy in everything that's happening around us. 
                            The million dollar question hence is quite obvious: How do we do that? <br><br>
                            We ourselves have the answer&nbsp; : &nbsp;United. </p>
                        <p class="lead">
                            Be it happiness or sadness, logical or illogical, relevant or irrelevant, we seem 
                            to celebrate everything and anything together. 
                            The bonding this class has achieved in such a short period of time has been unbelievable, 
                            yet fascinating to each of the onlookers.<br>
                            Unity though, is not an easy trait to achieve. Especially, when it's a coming together of 
                            people of vast social and linguistic differences.
                            This gives rise to yet another question :&nbsp; How united?<br></p>
                        <p class="lead">
                            Closer analysis has revealed that the past has left signiﬁcant scars on their majority. 
                            This unity, hence, seems to be the result of those individual attempts trying to turn a 
                            page and start afresh. These collective individual efforts along with that natural teen 
                            desire for frolics seemingly has made CSA that class in everyone's dreams.<br><br>
                        </p>        
                        <p class="lead">The future of CSA seems bright. We are a multi-talented group facing life with a smile. 
                            If "When spiders unite, they can tie down a lion", and CSA already seem to be a pride of lions... 
                            one can only imagine what's in the making.
